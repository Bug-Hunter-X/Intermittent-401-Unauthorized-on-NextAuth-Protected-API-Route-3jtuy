# Intermittent 401 Unauthorized on NextAuth Protected API Route

This repository demonstrates a bug where a NextAuth protected API route intermittently returns a 401 Unauthorized error, even when a valid session is present.  The issue is seemingly random and occurs without any clear pattern or triggering event.  The provided solution addresses this by explicitly checking for session properties and handling potential null values before use.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Attempt to access the protected API route. Note that the API route will occasionally, and unpredictably, fail with 401 Unauthorized error even if logged in.

## Solution

The solution involves explicitly checking for the existence of session properties before using them.  This mitigates the issue likely caused by asynchronous behavior or race conditions affecting session data availability within the API route handler.
